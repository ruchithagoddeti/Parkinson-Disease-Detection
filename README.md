# Parkinson-Disease-Detection
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement control, causing symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. Detecting Parkinson's disease early is crucial for effective management and treatment. Machine learning (ML) techniques can be employed for Parkinson's disease detection based on the analysis of various data sources.

Here's a short description of how machine learning can be used for Parkinson's disease detection:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather relevant data, which may include clinical information, patient history, and various biomedical signals such as voice recordings, gait patterns, and tremor measurements.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Identify key features from the collected data that may be indicative of Parkinson's disease. For example, in voice recordings, features related to pitch, intensity, and frequency can be extracted.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and standardize the features. This step ensures that the machine learning model receives high-quality input.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Use machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, or neural networks, to train a predictive model. The model learns patterns from the extracted features and the corresponding Parkinson's disease labels.

5. **Validation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using validation datasets to ensure its generalizability. This step helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model can accurately detect Parkinson's disease in new, unseen data.

6. **Testing:**
   - Assess the model's performance on a separate test dataset to confirm its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This step provides an estimate of how well the model will perform on new patient data.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Integrate the trained model into a user-friendly interface or healthcare system for practical use. This could involve creating a software application that takes input data and outputs predictions regarding the likelihood of Parkinson's disease.

Machine learning approaches for Parkinson's disease detection offer a non-invasive and potentially cost-effective way to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis, allowing for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
